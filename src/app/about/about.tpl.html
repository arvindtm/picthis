    The Elevator Pitch
    <small>For the lazy and impatient.</small>
  </h1>
  <p>
    <code>ng-boilerplate</code> is an opinionated kickstarter for web
    development projects. It's an attempt to create a simple starter for new
    web sites and apps: just download it and start coding. The goal is to
    have everything you need to get started out of the box; of course it has
    slick styles and icons, but it also has a best practice directory structure
    to ensure maximum code reuse. And it's all tied together with a robust
    build system chock-full of some time-saving goodness.
  </p>

  <h2>Why?</h2>


  <h2>What ng-boilerplate Is Not</h2>

  <h1 class="page-header">
    So What's Included?
    <small>I'll try to be more specific than "awesomeness".</small>
  </h1>
  <p>
    This section is just a quick introduction to all the junk that comes
    pre-packaged with <code>ng-boilerplate</code>. For information on how to
    use it, see the <a
      href="https://github.com/joshdmiller/ng-boilerplate#readme">project page</a> at
    GitHub.
  </p>



  <p>
    And, of course, <code>ng-boilerplate</code> is built on <a href="http://angularjs.org">AngularJS</a>,
    by the far the best JavaScript framework out there! But if you don't know
    that already, then how did you get here? Well, no matter - just drink the
    Kool Aid. Do it. You know you want to.
  </p>
  
  <h2>Twitter Bootstrap</h2>

  <p>
    You already know about this, right? If not, <a
      href="http://getbootstrap.com">hop on over</a> and check it out; it's
    pretty sweet. Anyway, all that wonderful stylistic goodness comes built in.
    The LESS files are available for you to import in your main stylesheet as
    needed - no excess, no waste. There is also a dedicated place to override
    variables and mixins to suit your specific needs, so updating to the latest
    version of Bootstrap is as simple as: 
  </p>

  <pre>$ cd vendor/twitter-bootstrap<br />$ git pull origin master</pre>

  <p>
    Boom! And victory is ours.
  </p>

  <h2>UI Bootstrap</h2>

  <p>
    You get the tabs, the tooltips, the accordions. You get your
    carousel, your modals, your pagination. And <i>more</i>.
    How about a quick demo? 
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li class="dropdown">
      <a class="btn dropdown-toggle">
        Click me!
      </a>
      <ul class="dropdown-menu">
        <li ng-repeat="choice in dropdownDemoItems">
          <a>{{choice}}</a>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Oh, and don't include jQuery;  
    you don't need it.
    This is better.
    Don't be one of those people. <sup>*</sup>
  </p>

  <p><small><sup>*</sup> Yes, there are exceptions.</small></p>



  <pre>&lt;i class="icon-flag"&gt;&lt/i&gt</pre>

  <p>
    And you get one of these: <i class="icon-flag"> </i>. Neat!
  </p>

  <h2>Placeholders</h2>

  <p>
    Angular Placeholders is a simple library for mocking up text and images. You
    can automatically throw around some "lorem ipsum" text:
  </p>

  <pre>&lt;p ph-txt="3s"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</pre>

  <p>
    Which gives you this:
  </p>

  <div class="pre">
    &lt;p&gt;
    <p ph-txt="3s"></p>
    &lt;/p&gt;
  </div>

  <p>
    Even more exciting, you can also create placeholder images, entirely 
    client-side! For example, this:
  </p>
  
  <pre>
&lt;img ph-img="50x50" /&gt;
&lt;img ph-img="250x150" class="img-polaroid" /&gt;
&lt;img ph-img="50x50" class="img-rounded" /&gt;
&lt;img ph-img="50x50" class="img-circle" /&gt;</pre>

  <p>
    Gives you this:
  </p>

  <div>
    <img ph-img="50x50" />
    <img ph-img="250x150" class="img-polaroid" />
	<img ph-img="250x150" class="img-polaroid" />
	<img ph-img="250x150" class="img-polaroid" />
    <img ph-img="50x50" class="img-rounded" />
    <img ph-img="50x50" class="img-circle" />
  </div>

  <p>
    Which is awesome.
  </p>
